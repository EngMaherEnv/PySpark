# PySpark 
PySpark is a great language for performing exploratory data analysis at scale, building machine learning pipelines, and creating ETLs for a data platform.

This repo goes from SparkContext SparkSession Spark Dataframes ... up to spark MLLIB (regression, classification, clustring and  NLP...etc  ) and Spark streaming.To get more Idea here are some examples about concepts and projects I went on in this Repo: 
- Aggregating DataFrame in PySpark
- Joining and Appending DataFrames in PySpark 
- Manipulating Data in DataFrames
- Handling Missing Data in PySpark
- building machine learning pipelines
### PySpark MLib
- Classification_in_PySparks_MLlib
- Genre classification for music 
- NLP Classification Fake Job Posting Predictions
- NLP_in_Pysparks_MLlib 
- Regression in Pysparks MLlib without functions
